Rightmeow.com
==============

This repository is the main repository for the website rightmeow.com. It is built on a node stack. I cloned the Passport base repository to get started since I would be using the authentication system. This is a semi functional site that has already implemented authentication. The goal was to implement payment subscription using Paypal. However, the project got scrapped but it was a great experience with the (almost) MEAN stack.
